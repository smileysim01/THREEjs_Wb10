1.Vertex Shader:
Inputs: The attributes of that vertex(like the screen-position of the 3D vertex) and uniforms.
Outputs: Screen position of transformed vertex(atleast in 2D), and can also output varying variables.

2.Fragment Shader:
Inputs: Properties of the fragment like screen position, interpolated varying variables from vertices and uniform variables.
Outputs: More properties of the fragment like color of the fragment on screen
