What lighting did you implement?

Diffuse directional light from z axis which changes as the camera moves.


Did you do anything beyond basic texure with diffuse lighting (explain)?

Yes. I have implemented a mix of two textures. 
First is the texture of earth. 
Second, the earth is visible as we are seeing it from space. This is because I have added a space texture with the earth texture.
The earth also spins on its axis.
