Where did you get your shader? Describe the source and include a link.
I got my shader from GLSL Sandbox link provided in the workbook.
I played around with the equations used to get a perfect result as per the objects.

In your own words, describe how this shader works. (3-5 sentences)

This is shader uses two uniforms - time and resolution.
Time has been applied using step function in .js file and in fragment shader file using sin functions.
For resolution, I have used value (800,800) in vec2 in .js file.
